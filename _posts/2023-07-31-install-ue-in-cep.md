With the release of [kota69th's Creative Expansion Pack](https://github.com/kota69th/CreativeExpansionPack)  (commonly refered to as CEP), we are able to build great creative rounds without limitations set by Mediatonic.

A lot of great functionality is locked behind UnityExplorer however. Here's how to install it:

## 1. Downloading the correct version of UnityExplorer

Go to the [UnityExplorer GitHub releases page](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer/releases/latest) and download the file "UnityExplorer.BepInEx.IL2CPP.zip". To download it directly, click [here](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer/releases/latest/download/UnityExplorer.BepInEx.IL2CPP.zip).

## 2. Extracting the files

Go to your Fall Guys installation folder (the place you installed CEP.)

To open it, right click Fall Guys in your Steam library, click "Manage" and then "Browse local files".

If you're on Epic, click "Manage" in your library, then click on the folder icon.

Make sure CEP is installed already and you ran the "Install_BepinEx.bat" file.

Go to the "BepinEx" folder, then plugins.

Open the zip file you downloaded earlier using a tool like [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org) and navigate through it: "UnityExplorer.BepInEx.IL2CPP" -> "plugins". Then, drag the "sinai-dev-UnityExplorer" folder to the plugins folder of your Fall Guys installation.

## 3. Starting the game

If you launch Fall Guys now, you should see UnityExplorer popping up when the game is launched. If it doesn't, make sure you followed all the steps correctly.
